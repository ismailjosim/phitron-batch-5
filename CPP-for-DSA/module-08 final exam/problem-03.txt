Problem Statement: Reverse It

You will be given data for N students, where each student will have a name (nm), class (cls), section (s) and student ID (id). The Headmaster decided to change the sections of the students. He wants to reverse their sections. Now he needs your help to do so.

Your task is reverse their section and print all the students data.

See the sample input and output for more clarifications.
