class and object

what is class?
It's a part of OOP
to implement dsa we need class and object
we will learn OOP in Python

when we need to create hold multiple value we need object. for example:
student:  name, age, roll, class, result etc.

if new need a group of data or multiple data for the same person we will use class object.

like this:
personOne = {
    name,
    age,
    roll,
    class,
    marks
}

it's also called user defined data type. because can defined various data-type here. example: {
    name:string,
    age:int,
    roll:int,
    class:string,
    marks:array
}

what is object?
int a = 10;
int a = when we create a variable using class it's called object
